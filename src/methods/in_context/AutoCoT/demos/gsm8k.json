        "rationale": " The driving time is 480/60= <<480/60=8>>8 hours  The time for breaks was 30+15+15=<<30+15+15=60>>60 minutes  So she spent 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour for rest stops.  So it took her 8+1=<<8+1=9>>9 hours Final answer: 9",

        "question": "Gina is participating in a neighborhood clean-up filling bags with litter. She was able to collect two bags of litter herself. The rest of the neighborhood together collected 82 times as much as Gina did by herself. Each bag of litter weighs 4 pounds. How many pounds was all the litter they collected?",
        "rationale": " The rest of the neighborhood collected 82 * 2 = <<82*2=164>>164 bags of litter.  With Ginaâ€™s bags, they had 164 + 2 = <<164+2=166>>166 bags of litter.  Thus, the litter weighed 166 * 4 = <<166*4=664>>664 pounds. Final answer: 664",

        "question": "John's neighbor tells him to walk his dog for 1 hour each day for a total of $10. He does this for April, save for the 4 Sundays in April. He later spent $50 on books and gave his sister Kaylee the same amount. How much money did John have left?",
        "rationale": " April has 30 days, so if he didn't walk the dog on Sundays, he worked for a total of 30 days - 4 days = <<30-4=26>>26 days.  If each day he earned $10, he ends up with 26 days * $10/day = $<<26*10=260>>260 .  After buying books and giving his sister $50, he ends up with $260 - $50 - $50 = $<<260-50-50=160>>160 Final answer: 160",
