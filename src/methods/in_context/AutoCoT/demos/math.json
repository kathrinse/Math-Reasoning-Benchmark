        "rationale": "We see that $8^2+15^2=64+225=289=17^2$.  So the triangle is a right triangle with legs $8$ and $15$, and thus its area is\n\n$$\\frac{8(15)}{2}=\\boxed{60}$$. Final answer: 60",

Thus, $(a, b) = (6, 1)$ is the only possibility. Then the answer is \\[a^3 - 3ab^2 = 6^3-3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1^2 = \\boxed{198}.\\]. Final answer: 198",
